Secret signing key has been saved in the file above. To populate
your binary cache:

    $ nix-build | cachix push linum-jupyter-lab

Or if you'd like to use the signing key on another machine or CI:

    $ export CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY=4igT/1n2QYaT2doKGL0KzNcXGUPVpZOJcxnqRGCmhxWSnvon5Q2G1mIgWT91+G/B6dpbPck8dx0/QuTCdH6w2A==
    $ nix-build | cachix push linum-jupyter-lab

To instruct Nix to use the binary cache:

    $ cachix use linum-jupyter-lab

IMPORTANT: Make sure to make a backup for the signing key above, as you have the only copy.

▶ nix-instantiate default.nix | cachix push linum-jupyter-lab
